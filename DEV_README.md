# Developer Notes

## Installing With Netbeans

This is old information that may no longer be useful. We currently use IntelliJ IDEA for development.

- Download and install the latest version of [NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads/). *Take the Jave EE Bundle that comes with GlassFish/Tomcat*
- Create a new project -> Java Web -> Web Application with Existing Sources.
   - Choose the root of the repository as the location for your project.
- You can now run/update the project easily.
